Improved description:
This project aims to explore the utilization of the DAPR framework in conjunction with the Blazor framework using C#. 
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of DAPR's capabilities and how it can enhance the development process in the 
context of web applications built with Blazor. Through this project, we aim to learn and experiment with DAPR's features
such as service invocation, state management, pub/sub messaging, and distributed tracing. The project will involve creating 
sample applications, conducting experiments, and documenting the findings to share with the developer community. By combining DAPR and Blazor, 
we hope to leverage the benefits of both frameworks and explore new possibilities in building modern, scalable, and resilient web applications.
The code and documentation for this project will be hosted on GitHub for easy collaboration and knowledge sharing.
